# AUTOMATIC-PILL-DISPENSOR
This project implements an automated pill dispensing system using Arduino, RTC DS3231, a servo motor, and a buzzer. The system checks real-time data to trigger alerts and dispenses pills at scheduled times using servo rotation. It ensures single dispensing per dose and resets daily for continuous operation.
